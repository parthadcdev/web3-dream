## üìã Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Cursor Settings

1. **Open Cursor IDE**
2. **Navigate to Settings**:
   - `Cursor` ‚Üí `Settings...` ‚Üí `Cursor Settings`
   - Or use `Cmd/Ctrl + ,`

3. **Access MCP Configuration**:
   - Click on `Tools & Integrations` tab
   - Scroll down to `MCP Tools` section
   - Click `Add Custom MCP`

4. **The system will create/open** `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

### Step 2: Unified MCP Configuration

The unified MCP configuration is already set up in `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tracechain-unified": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./mcp-server-unified.js"],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_ROOT": "/Users/partha/Work/web3-dream",
        "NODE_ENV": "development",
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": "your_linear_api_key",
        "LINEAR_TEAM_ID": "your_team_id",
        "LINEAR_WORKSPACE_ID": "your_workspace_id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: This unified configuration replaces the previous multiple MCP servers with a single, comprehensive server.

### Step 3: Start the Unified MCP Server

The unified MCP server is ready to use. Start it with:

```bash
cd /Users/partha/Work/web3-dream
./run-mcp-unified.sh start
```

**Available commands:**
- `./run-mcp-unified.sh start` - Start the server
- `./run-mcp-unified.sh stop` - Stop the server
- `./run-mcp-unified.sh status` - Check server status
- `./run-mcp-unified.sh test` - Test server functionality
- `./run-mcp-unified.sh logs` - View server logs

### Step 4: Install Additional Dependencies (Optional)

For enhanced functionality, install these packages:

```bash
# Security scanning
npm install -g @snyk/cli

# Smart contract analysis
npm install -g @hardhat/console

# API testing
npm install -g artillery
```

### Step 5: Verify MCP Connection

1. **Restart Cursor IDE**
2. **Check MCP Status**:
   - Go to `Cursor` ‚Üí `Settings...` ‚Üí `Tools & Integrations`
   - Look for green status indicators next to your MCP servers
3. **Test MCP Tools**:
   - Open any file in your TraceChain project
   - Use `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` to open command palette
   - Type "MCP" to see available MCP tools

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Unified MCP Server Not Starting
1. Check if server is running: `./run-mcp-unified.sh status`
2. View server logs: `./run-mcp-unified.sh logs`
3. Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x`)
4. Verify Node.js is installed and accessible
5. Check environment variables are set correctly

### Tools Not Available
1. Restart Cursor IDE after configuration changes
2. Verify unified MCP server shows green status
3. Check that project files exist at specified paths
4. Ensure Linear API credentials are configured
5. Test server functionality: `./run-mcp-unified.sh test`

### Performance Issues
1. Check server status and restart if needed
2. Monitor server logs for errors
3. Verify system resources (CPU, memory)
4. Use specific tool categories instead of running all tools

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Regular Health Checks
Run project health checks weekly to track progress:
```
"Use MCP to check project health and compare with last week's results"
```

### 2. Security-First Development
Always validate security before committing:
```
"Use MCP to validate security of all modified files before commit"
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring
Monitor performance as you add features:
```
"Use MCP to check if new API endpoints meet performance targets"
```

### 4. Automated Testing
Generate tests for new components:
```
"Use MCP to generate comprehensive tests for new smart contract"
```

### 5. Linear Integration
Use Linear for issue tracking and project management:
```
"Use MCP to create a bug report for the authentication issue"
"Use MCP to search for all high-priority issues"
```

### 6. Build & Deployment Automation
Automate your build and deployment processes:
```
"Use MCP to build the frontend for production"
"Use MCP to deploy the application to staging"
```

```

### CI/CD Integration
Include MCP checks in your CI pipeline:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: MCP Security Check
  run: |
    # Run MCP security validation
    # Fail build if security score < 80
```

### Daily Development Routine
1. **Morning**: Run project health check
2. **Before coding**: Analyze files you'll be modifying
3. **During development**: Use real-time validation
4. **Before commit**: Run comprehensive security check
5. **End of day**: Generate tests for new features
